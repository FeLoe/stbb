"Rhein-Mosel-Delta Blues" (Text und Musik: Martin Schwaab)

When you were young, boy, you left your home
Blues beside you, man, when you were gone,
Someday you came back, 'cause you love your home

You strayed trough towns, miles away - so far,
You saw those lands, too much whiskey in the jar,
But now you here at home, Rhine-Mosel-Delta!

Ref.:
Rhine-Mosel-Delta Blues, Rhine-Mosel-Delta Blues,
Rhine-Mosel-Delta Blues, Rhine-Mosel-Delta Blues,
That's the best place ever, that's the only truth

Now I'm here, settled down where the two rivers flow
I don't know, someday where my children'll go,
But the'll never forget: Our good old home

Oh Yeah Koblenz, pretty - nights and days!"
I'm so glad, tears roll down my face,
Well,that's the junction in the whole deep space

Ref.:
//:Rhine-Mosel-Delta Blues, Rhine-Mosel-Delta Blues,
Rhine-Mosel-Delta Blues, Rhine-Mosel-Delta Blues,
That's the best place ever, that's the only truth://
